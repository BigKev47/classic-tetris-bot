# classic-tetris-bot
Script + utility for bots to play NES Tetris on the FCEUX emulator.

To run, you need FCEUX and a copy of of the original ROM for Tetris.

Once in FCEUX, go to File -> Lua -> New Lua Script Window and load tetrisbot.lua.

If you want to highlight where the bot has decided to put the next piece, type "debug" into the command-line arguments.
